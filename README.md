# Data Analysis with SQL:
For each dataset, a table was created with a surrogate key to serve as the primary key, and a composite index was created on the date and hour columns to optimize querying and retrieving data.
EDA was performed using SQL queries to investigate patterns, relationships, and trends within the data. Various statistical and aggregate functions were utilized to extract meaningful insights about the demand for Uber and pickup patterns and correlations.
